eHP Calculator
This program allows you to calculate your effective HP (eHP) in the game League of Legends based on your HP, MR, and Armor stats.
You can enter your base HP, MR, and Armor, along with your bonus HP, MR, and Armor in the starting window. Base and bonus values are separated for ease of recalculating based on different itemization. 
Upon clicking “calculate” a new window will open displaying total HP, Armor, and MR values, along with eHP values vs. magic and physical damage. The “close” button on the results window will close it, while the “exit” button on the main window closes the program entirely. 

Hovering over the effective HP images/labels will display a tooltip explaining what stats affect each of them.
